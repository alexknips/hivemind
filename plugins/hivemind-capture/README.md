# HiveMind Capture Plugin

This directory is both the Codex capture plugin and the Claude Code
`hivemind-capture` plugin. The Claude package installs:

- `/hivemind-capture:capture` for explicit writes through the deterministic
  capture helper. Use `--kind decision`, `--kind evidence`, or
  `--kind hypothesis` when the kind is known.
- `/hivemind-capture:capture-decision` as the legacy decision-only wrapper for
  `emit decision.capture`.
- `/hivemind-capture:query-decisions` for bounded `query search_decisions`
  reads.
- `/hivemind-capture:classify-queue` (Worker A) — drains the pending
  classification work queue using the agent's subscription seat. Run after a
  session to classify batches that the server-side classifier has not yet
  processed. See [Queue drain](#queue-drain-worker-a) below.
- A `hivemind` MCP stdio server wired to `hivemind mcp`.
- The `hivemind-capture` skill for capture boundaries and provenance rules.
- The Claude `active-capture` skill, which nudges `/capture <text>
  [--kind decision|evidence|hypothesis|blocker]` during live durable-decision
  moments while avoiding synthetic test data and routing chatter.
- The `citation` skill, which guides the agent to pin URL versions (commit
  hash, revision ID, or access date) when a link appears in a capture context.

The shared helper defaults to `source=agent` and derives
`actor_id=agent:<tool>:<session>` from the active session. Under Codex it uses
`CODEX_THREAD_ID`, `CODEX_SESSION_ID`, or `CODEX_TASK_ID`; under Claude Code it
uses `CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` or `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`. In Gas City sessions it can
fall back to `GC_SESSION_ID`/`GC_SESSION_NAME`.

## Install

Install the HiveMind CLI first so `hivemind` is on `PATH`.

From Claude Code, add this repository as a marketplace and install the plugin:

```text
/plugin marketplace add alexknips/hivemind
/plugin install hivemind-capture@hivemind
/reload-plugins
```

For local development from this checkout:

```text
/plugin marketplace add .
/plugin install hivemind-capture@hivemind
/reload-plugins
```

Claude Code can also test the plugin directory directly:

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./plugins/hivemind-capture
```

For rig-local dogfooding, copy the active capture skill into the checkout's
project skills directory:

```bash
plugins/hivemind-capture/scripts/install-active-capture-skill.sh --project-dir .
```

The default ledger is the project-local `./hivemind/` directory. The bundled MCP
server descriptor pins that location so agents launched from this checkout use
the same ledger without per-session setup. To use another ledger for slash
commands, set the plugin option `hivemind_dir`, export `HIVEMIND_DIR`, or pass
`--hivemind-dir`.

## Provenance Defaults

Claude plugin writes default to `actor_id=agent:claude:<session>` and
`source=agent`. The slash command uses `CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` or
`CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`; the bundled MCP server starts with `--agent-tool
claude` and uses the same session environment for write tools when `actor_id` is
omitted.

Codex skill writes use the same convention with
`actor_id=agent:codex:<session>`, deriving the session from
`CODEX_SESSION_ID`, `CODEX_TASK_ID`, or `HIVEMIND_CODEX_SESSION`.

Bare terminal writes such as `hivemind emit decision.proposed ...` default to
`actor_id=human:<git config user.email>` and `source=human` when `--actor` is
not supplied.

## Verify

Capture one decision:

```text
/hivemind-capture:capture "Use the Claude plugin for local capture" --kind decision --title "Use the Claude plugin for local capture" --rationale "The plugin installs commands, skill guidance, and MCP without project-local setup" --topic-keys agents,claude,distribution --options plugin,manual-mcp --chose plugin
```

Capture one evidence item:

```text
/hivemind-capture:capture "The plugin smoke test wrote a decision and queried it back" --kind evidence
```

The command prints a one-line confirmation and a query suggestion. Run the
suggested query or use:

```text
/hivemind-capture:query-decisions --actor-id agent:claude:<session> --source agent --limit 10
```

The MCP server appears as `hivemind` in Claude Code's MCP tool list after the
plugin is loaded.

## Queue drain (Worker A)

HiveMind accumulates unclassified ingest batches in a work queue. Worker A
drains this queue using the agent's subscription seat — no API key required.

### Run manually

```text
/hivemind-capture:classify-queue
```

The command lists pending batches, classifies each one using your subscription
model, and writes `IngestBatchClassified` events. Report at the end: batches
processed and total captures written.

Pass `--limit N` to cap the number of batches processed per run (default 20):

```text
/hivemind-capture:classify-queue --limit 5
```

### Check queue depth

```bash
hivemind classify-queue list --json | jq length
```

### Session hook (optional)

Add `scripts/check-classify-queue.sh` as a `Stop` hook in `.claude/settings.json`
to see a nudge when unclassified batches are waiting:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [{
      "matcher": "",
      "command": "plugins/hivemind-capture/scripts/check-classify-queue.sh"
    }]
  }
}
```

The hook only prints a one-line notification; it does not drain autonomously.

### Bounds

- Each batch = one model invocation (subscription-seat bound).
- Large backlogs drain across multiple `/classify-queue` runs — the queue persists.
- The server-side classifier (Worker B) and Worker A share the same queue;
  concurrent classification is idempotent (last-writer-wins per batch).

## Uninstall

```text
/plugin uninstall hivemind-capture@hivemind --prune
```

Remove the marketplace if no other HiveMind plugins are installed:

```text
/plugin marketplace remove hivemind
```
